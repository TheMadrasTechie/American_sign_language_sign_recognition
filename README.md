# American_sign_language_sign_recognition
This is a jupyter notebook program to train and detect the hand gestures of american signlanguage using LSTM and Mediapipe.

I used tutorials from **Nicholas Renotte**
Here's his youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/NicholasRenotte

You can find the tutorial that I used to create the gesture detection in the following video.

Here is the link for the Dataset.

They are numpy arrays of all the gestures stored.
Thet are of 4 different people.
2 - Man
1 - Woman
1 - Kid


In the future, I will try to create a blog post and share it.
